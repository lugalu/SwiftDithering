     Applies Ordered Dithering, also known as Bayer dithering to the image,  this dither support colors on the RGB space.
     The image must contain an CGImage to be processed, and this method can cause crashes that Cannot be throw becasue of the draw function.
     - Parameters:
       - bayerSize: The Matrix size used to calculate the color difference;
       - spread: Max distance between the calculated value and the original value by default  equals to 1.0, Warning: the value isn't clamped so going above the threshold can cause artifacts;
       - isGrayScale: if the image should be converted to grayScale only
       - spread: how much deviation should exist when adding the threshold to each pixel recommended to be within 0-1
       - numberOfBits: if the image is colored how much colors you allow
       - downSampleFactor: factor(2Ë†n) to down sample the image by default is set to 1(halves the image) to not downsample make this 0.
     - Returns: UIImage with the dithering applied
     - Tag: applyOrderedDither
